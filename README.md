## What

This repo contains a simple mobile app written three times using three different mobile SDKs which have a **declarative UI**:

- **[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)**
- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)**
- **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)**

## Why

I wanted to try these mobile SDKs that have **declarative UI** and how it feels to create an app with each one of them. I was interested in diving deeper into the developer experience with these tools, languages and libraries.

**SwiftUI** is the new hotness for cross-platform UIs on Apple platforms. **Flutter** promises a single cross-platform codebase for mobile, web and web. **React Native** is familiar to React developers and enables deployment to both iOS and Android.

I chose these SDKs because of their modern **declarative UI** and hopefully better developer experience than what I've been used to with UIKit and standard Android.

I have a strong background in native iOS and Android, but I haven't done any large projects with these mobile app technologies.

I wanted to create a simple app in all these to learn them better and see what it's like to start a new project with these techs in 2020. What comes in the box, how easy is it to set up a new project, what else is needed for a simple real world app?

The aim is to create an app that looks and feels pretty much native.

## The App

The app shows [BoardGameGeek's The Hotness list](https://boardgamegeek.com/), and allows user to view details of each board game. I tried to make app functionality and code organization as similar as possible for all the apps. Data is fetched from a custom proxy server sitting infront of [BGG XML Api 2](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to convert XML to JSON so the mobile app doesn't have to deal with XML.

The app has these features:

- Network requests
- JSON parsing
- List view
- View/screen navigation
- Image loading & scaling
- Somewhat complex text layout

Every complex mobile app has functionality like this, so I'm sampling a good portion of what it feels like to develop a real app with these technologies.

## Prerequisites for Running The Apps

You'll need to have these tools installed. I have the versions listed.

- Xcode 12.0.1
- Flutter 1.20.4
- React Native 0.63.2
- Node.js v13.14.0
- npm 6.14.4
- Docker v19.03.12

Please refer to the documentation of those tools on how to install them.

## Running The Apps

### Starting Server

You need the server running before launching the mobile apps. Server is made with Node.js and is configured to run in Docker. You can also run it locally, but I don't have instructions or configurations for that.

```
cd Server
docker build -t mobile-server-2020 .
docker run -e DEBUG=1 -e PORT=6000 -p 38651:6000 -d mobile-server-2020
```

### SwiftUI

Open `SwiftUI/TheHotnessSwiftUI.xcodeproj` and run the project (Cmd-R).

### React Native

```
cd ReactNative
npm install
npx pod-install
npx react-native run-ios
npx react-native start
```

### Flutter

Launch iPhone Simulator.

```
cd Flutter
flutter run
```

# My Impressions

Overall I found all of these SDKs to be easy to set up and use to create the sample app. I think all of them were equally easy to create this app.

Using UI toolkit which uses a declarative UI feels really great. All SDKs have a great story there. Building the app and UI was pretty fast, a few hours per app. Once I had everything for the list view, building the detail view was fast.

All had their own quirks with regards to how to get the layout to what I wanted. With experience I would think they're all capable, fast and easy to use.

I think I like SwiftUI the most: good defaults and nice syntax means there's not much to code write, and view modifiers are a nice way of tuning layout. Modifiers also apply to whole subtrees, which may be handy sometimes. The language has nice features and I feel SwiftUI is a good library, albeit it seems to be somewhat deep and complex when looking at everything it offers. Simple things are simple, however.

Overall developer experience was best with React Native. Hot reload worked great and made development fast and fun, app looked ok (out of the box), layout (structure) code wasn't too verbose, and styling & tuning looks and layout was clean and easy to do. TypeScript feels a nice, clean and modern language. React Native's API feels clean and simple.

Unfortunately Flutter wasn't that impressive to me. It's developer experience didn't feel better in any area than either of the other choices. Hot reload was much better than SwiftUI's, but not better than React Native's. Language and library weren't as good IMO. Overall Flutter seems good, but it just doesn't excite me at all. The two other SDKs feel interesting, but this is a very personal opinion.

I've included a sample view for each language. It's the row view used to display a single game in the list. SwiftUI has the shortest code.

The technologies have their strengths and weaknesses, mostly relating to supporting (or not supporting) multiple platforms (with varying levels of grace). Also getting little details just right for each platform will be more difficult the further away the SDK is from the platform conceptually. So the question becomes, what kind of an app are you building?

## SwiftUI

```swift
struct GameRow: View {
    let game: Game
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            RoundedThumbnail(url: game.thumbnailUrl)
            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                Text(game.name)
                Text(game.yearPublished)
                    .font(.caption)
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
            }
            .padding(.trailing)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Good

- üëç The future of native iOS.
- üëç First class citizen on iOS.
- üëç Fully native UI with platform look & feel (on iOS).
- üëç Code looks pretty clean with minimal boilerplate. Perhaps has the best defaults for layout code.
- üëç Usable on all Apple platforms.
- üëç Doesn't bloat the app with tons of library code.

#### Could be better

- üëé Requires iOS 13 (or debatably 14).
- üëé Is still very much under development, unfinished.
- üëé Hot reload is not quite at the level of Flutter and React Native.
- üëé No Android or web.
- üëé Project template doesn't include a `.gitignore` file. Easy to find on the web, but why not include by default?
- üëé Documentation isn't quite there yet.
- üëé Layout has good defaults, but some things seem harder to grok.
- üëé State management is, well, complicated. Probably stems from Swift's value and reference semantics and their differences. I really love value semantics, but they seem to complicate things in SwiftUI.

## React Native

```typescript
export const GameRow = ({game}: {game: Game}) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.gameRow}>
      <Image style={styles.thumbnail} source={{uri: game.thumbnailUrl}} />
      <View style={styles.textContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>{game.name}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.yearPublished}>{game.yearPublished}</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  gameRow: {
    backgroundColor: Colors.white,
    padding: 10,
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
  },
  textContainer: {
    padding: 10,
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  thumbnail: {
    width: 80,
    height: 80,
    resizeMode: 'cover',
    borderRadius: 5,
    overflow: 'hidden',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 18,
  },
  yearPublished: {
    marginTop: 1,
    fontSize: 14,
    color: '#999',
  },
});
```
#### Good

- üëç Very pleasant development experience.
- üëç Clean API.
- üëç Big community.
- üëç Pretty clean code, separate styles (`StyleSheet.create()`) are a plus and a minus. I can't see the style inline with layout structure, but on the otherhand the style is reusable.
- üëç Documentation. Hooks documentation, for example, is just superb.

#### Could be better

- üëé Doesn't feel like a really cohesive whole.
- üëé Have to know which libraries are the best for each use case.
- üëé TypeScript is great, but there are still hairy things from JS (comparison for example).
- üëé Platform look & feel polish is not there, out of the box. I bet there are libraries to help with that.

## Flutter

```dart
class GameListRow extends StatelessWidget {
  GameListRow({Key key, this.game}) : super(key: key);

  final Game game;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Row(children: [
        ThumbnailView(thumbnailUrl: game.thumbnailUrl),
        Flexible(
            child: Container(
                margin: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 8),
                child: Column(
                  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                  children: [
                    Text('${game.name}',
                        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6),
                    Text('${game.yearPublished}',
                        style: Theme.of(context)
                            .textTheme
                            .bodyText2
                            .apply(color: Colors.grey))
                  ],
                )))
      ]),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border(
          bottom: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Colors.grey.shade300),
        ),
        color: Colors.transparent,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Good

- üëç Dart is easy to learn. It's a non-surprising language, which is a good thing.
- üëç Probably closest to true cross-platfrom from one codebase.
- üëç Feels more like a cohesive whole than React Native.

#### Could be better

- üëé Flutter view APIs are a bit verbose. Maybe I just don't know all the tricks yet. With easy composition I could create my own API on top of the Flutter components to make building UIs a bit less verbose.
- üëé Dart syntax feels a bit dated. Easy to learn, like Go, but I feel language design has evolved and modern Swift or TypeScript is years ahead of Dart. Null safety isn't on par for 2020 IMO. Seems it's coming, but it's still a tech preview.
- üëé There's a lot of boilerplate. JSON parsing, for example, is very tedious to write. This seems to be by design.
- üëé Community feels much smaller than React Native or SwiftUI.
- üëé Doesn't look like an iOS app straight from the box. Seems there are platform-specific themes, but I didn't look into those. On the other hand, real cross-platform support means the app probably just can't be very platform-specific in its look & feel.
- üëé Overall very meh for me. App doesn't look like an iOS app or even that great, Dart feels a bit dated, Flutter view APIs feel verbose to use.

# More Complex Things to Try

Adding more things could really stress these SDKs to see how easy they are for making polished mobile apps:

- Proper error handling & retries for networking
- Polished platform UI look & feel
- Animations
- Text editing
- Image scaling and display
- Pull to refresh
- Complex navigation structure
- Video player
- Embedded web content
- Complex gesture interactions
- Rich, editable model on the client
- Biometric authentication
- Unit tests
- UI tests
- Push notifications
- etc.

It's the little platform look & feel things that take a lot of time to create. Cross-platform toolkits usually make it harder to get all the details right.

Implementing these things would increase my knowledge in the SDKs and how to create full-featured, rich and polished apps with them.
